### Gecko

This is my private fork of Mozill's [Gecko-Dev repository](https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev). This repository contains the source code for Gecko and Spidermonkey.

[Gecko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_(software)) is the web browser engine that powers Mozilla, Firefox and a [whole](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko/Versions) bunch of other software.

24. [Canvas fingerprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_fingerprinting) is one of a number of browser fingerprinting techniques of tracking online users that allow websites to identify and track visitors using HTML5 canvas element. The technique received wide media coverage in 2014 after researchers from Princeton University and KU Leuven University described it in their paper [The Web never forgets](https://securehomes.esat.kuleuven.be/~gacar/persistent/index.html).The privacy concerns regarding canvas fingerprinting centre around the fact that even deleting cookies and clearing the cache will not be sufficient for users to avoid online tracking.
