### Gecko

This is my private fork of Mozill's Gecko-Dev repository (https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev). This repository contains the source code for Gecko and Spidermonkey.

Gecko (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_(software)) is the web browser engine that powers Mozilla, Firefox and a whole (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko/Versions) bunch of other software.
