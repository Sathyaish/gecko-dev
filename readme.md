### Gecko

This is my private fork of Mozill's [Gecko-Dev repository](https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev). This repository contains the source code for Gecko and Spidermonkey.

[Gecko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_(software)) is the web browser engine that powers Mozilla, Firefox and a [whole](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko/Versions) bunch of other software.
